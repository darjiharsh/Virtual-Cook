        'These blueberry lemon bars are the perfect combination of sweet and tart. Theyre made with a buttery shortbread crust and a delicious blueberry lemon filling, making for a refreshing and delightful treat. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, cream together the flour, butter, and powdered sugar until the mixture is smooth and crumbly. Press the mixture evenly into a greased 8-inch square baking dish. Bake the crust for 15-18 minutes or until its lightly golden brown. While the crust is baking, make the filling. In a medium bowl, mix together the blueberries, lemon juice, lemon zest, granulated sugar, flour, eggs, and salt until everything is well combined. Pour the filling mixture over the hot crust, spreading it evenly. Bake the bars for an additional 20-25 minutes or until the filling is set and the edges are lightly golden. Let the bars cool completely, then dust with powdered sugar Cut into squares and serve.'
